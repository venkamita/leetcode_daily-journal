# 🧠 LeetCode Daily Journal

Welcome to my personal journey of solving **one LeetCode problem every day**. This repo documents my struggles, mistakes, thought processes, and eventual solutions in detail. The goal is not just to solve problems, but to **understand, improve, and grow consistently** as a problem solver.

## 📅 Daily Structure

Each folder is named by **day number**, and inside each file, you'll find:

- 📌 **Title**: Problem number and name  
- 🧠 **Notes**: Initial thoughts, errors, and learnings  
- 🧪 **Optimization**: Time & space complexity discussions  
- 🧾 **Code**: First attempt, final code, and their differences  
- 🔁 **Reflection**: What I could’ve done better

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Build strong intuition in DSA in python
- Train consistency and discipline
- Prepare for interviews by learning from mistakes
- Create a personal code journal for future reference
